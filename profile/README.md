# ThrillTech

Welcome welcome welcome!

As with all dungeons, we keep our code-pit dimly lit and out of sight of curious or prying eyes.
While you will probably never see them, rest assured that our code demons, ninjas, and other cool-sounding-descriptors 
are hard at work creating the most incredible technology.

We are currently **NOT** hiring, but do check back if you're interested in becoming part
of our team.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
